🚀 Just completed my **Blinkit Sales & Delivery Performance Dashboard** using Power BI!

In this project, I focused on transforming raw data into meaningful business insights with a clean Blinkit-style UI. The goal was to analyze sales trends, customer behavior, and delivery performance in a simple and interactive way.

🔎 **Key Highlights:**
✅ KPI Cards – Total Orders, Total Sales, Avg Order Value, Total Customers
✅ Monthly Sales Trend Analysis (Bar + Line Charts)
✅ Payment Method Distribution (Pie Chart)
✅ Delivery Status Performance Analysis
✅ Interactive Slicers (Year, Customer Segment, Payment Method, Delivery Status)
✅ Professional layout inspired by real business dashboards

📊 This project helped me strengthen my skills in:
Power BI • Data Modeling • DAX Measures • Data Visualization • Dashboard Design

I’m continuously learning and improving as a Data Analyst.
Your feedback and suggestions are always welcome! 🙌
